## Where can JavaScript Run?

JavaScript code can be included in any website.

Thanks to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) or [Deno](https://deno.com/) JavaScript code can be executed outside of the browser as well.

With extra technologizes like [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) or [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) you can build mobile apps based on JavaScript.
