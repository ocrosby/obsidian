## Creating a React Project

## Browser Based

In your browser enter `react.new`.

This will create a new React project in `codesandbox.io`.

This gives you an in browser development environment to experiment with.

## Locally

### Prerequisites

You will need to first install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). Typically I install `Node` using the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) since it allows you to run multiple versions of `Node` on your machine.

You will utilize [Vite](https://vite.dev/) to scaffold a new react environment so make sure to install that after installing `Node`.
