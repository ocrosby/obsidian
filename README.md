# ðŸ§  Obsidian Vault

Welcome to my personal Obsidian knowledge vault.

This workspace is organized using the [PARA Method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) â€” a simple framework for managing projects, areas of responsibility, reference materials, and archives.

## ðŸ“‚ Reorganized Structure Overview

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Improvements

- **PARA Compliance**: Proper classification of Projects vs Areas vs Resources
- **Logical Grouping**: Related technologies grouped together
- **Clear Separation**: Time-bound projects vs ongoing responsibilities
- **Expanded Resources**: Better organization of reference materials
- **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer top-level directories, better organization
