# Obsidian Vault Organization (PARA Method)

This Obsidian vault follows theÂ [PARA method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/)Â for digital organization. PARA stands for:

- **Projects**: Short-term efforts with clear goals and deadlines
    
- **Areas**: Long-term responsibilities or spheres of activity
    
- **Resources**: Topics or interests you're researching or learning
    
- **Archives**: Inactive or completed items no longer actively used
    

In addition, this vault includesÂ `Inbox`Â andÂ `Templates`Â folders to support quick capture and reuse.
