## Step 1. Start from your goal

Get crystal-clear on:

- Why am I making this project?
- Who is this project for?
- What is going to make it valuable?

This avoids your project from becoming directionless.

**Build something digestible**

**Emphasize clean understandable code**

## Step 2. Write user stories

Examples

- The user should be able to upload a file
- The user should be able to create an account
- The user should be able to view a dashboard

Note: These user stories should remain non-technical

You usually want to have 10-20 user stories before getting started.

The main point is to 

1. write down exactly what a user should be able to do
2. how the app is going to work for them

## Step 3. Define your data models

Sketch out each model and the properties that they might need.

Think through all of the data the app is supposed to manipulate.

For example:

### User's Model

- users may have many posts

### Post's Model

- posts may have many comments

### Comment's Model

- comments belong to users & different posts

## Step 4. Nail a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

For the MVP remove anything previously planned that isn't required for the app to function.
