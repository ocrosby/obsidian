## Step 1. Start from your goal

Get crystal-clear on:

- Why am I making this project?
- Who is this project for?
- What is going to make it valuable?

This avoids your project from becoming directionless.

**Build something digestible**

**Emphasize clean understandable code**

## Step 2. Write user stories

Examples

- The user should be able to upload a file
- The user should be able to create an account
- The user should be able to view a dashboard

Note: These user stories should remain non-technical

You usually want to have 10-20 user stories before getting started.

The main point is to 

1. write down exactly what a user should be able to do
2. how the app is going to work for them
