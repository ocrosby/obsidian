# a and i Text Objects

- `i` = inner
- `a` = around

### Example

| Command | Description                          |
|---------|--------------------------------------|
| `ciw`   | Change **inner word**                |
| `caw`   | Change **a word** (includes space)   |
| `di(`   | Delete **inside parentheses**        |
| `da(`   | Delete **around parentheses**        |

Think: `i` is precise, `a` is inclusive.
