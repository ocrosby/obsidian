## What is a change?

Everything you execute while in insert mode (up until you hit `Esc` to exit insert mode) is considered a change. So you can do multiple things then essentially replay the last "change" by using the dot command. In that sense the dot command is a minature macro.

## The Replace Command

Moving the cursor to a character that needs to be altered you type

`r<c>`

where `<c>` is the character you want to replace the current character with.

## The Change Operator

Moving the cursor to a character in a word you type

`ce`

this will allow you to change text until the end of the word. 

`ce` deletes the word and places you in Insert mode.
`cc` does the same for the whole line

The change operator works in the same way as delete.

`c [number] motion`

The motions are the same such as `w` (word) and `$` (end of line).


## Cursor Location and File Status

`C_G` shows your location in the file and the file status.
`<line_number>G` moves you to the specified line.

## The Search Command

Type `/` followed by a phrase to search for the the phrase.

### Repeating the search

After searching for a phrase you can enter `n` to repeat the search.

To search for the same phrase in the opposite direction enter `N`.

Initially to search for a phrase in the backward direction, use `?` instead of `/`.

To go back where you came from press `C_o`. Repeat to go back further. `C_i` goes forward.

## Matching Parenthesis Search

Type `%` to find a matching ),], or }


## The Substitute Command

Type :s/old/new/g to substitute `new` for `old` globally within the string.

This will replace all occurrences of `old` with `new`.

Type `:s/old/new/` to replace the first occurrence of `old` with `new`.

Type `:#,#s/old/new/g` to replace every occurrence of `old` with `new` between two lines.

Type `:%s/old/new/g` to change every occurrence in the whole file

Type `:%s/old/new/gc` to find every occurrence in the whole file with a prompt whether to substitute or not.


## Execute External Commands

Type `:!` followed by an external command to execute that command.


## Copy and Paste text

Use the `y` operator to copy text and the `p` operator to paste it

Use visual mode to select text and type `y` to yank (copy) the highlighted text.

Move the cursor to where you want to paste the information then type `p` to put (paste) the text.

Note: You can also use `y` as an operator: `yw` yanks one word, `yy` yanks the whole like, then p puts that line.
