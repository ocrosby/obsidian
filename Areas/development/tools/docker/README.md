# Docker

## What is it?

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in isolated environments called containers. These containers package up an application with all of its dependencies, such as libraries and configuration files, ensuring that the application runs consistently across different environments. Docker helps streamline the development process, making it easier to deploy applications and scale them as needed.

### List all docker containers

```shell
docker ps
```

### Listing all docker containers (both running and stopped ones)

```shell
docker ps -a
```
