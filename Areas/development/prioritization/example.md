## **‚úÖ Real-World Example: Submitting an Initiative Proposal for PRIORIS+ Evaluation**

  

### **üë§ Submitted By:**

  

**Product Manager** ‚Äì Alicia Torres

**Date:** August 1, 2025

**Context:** Q4 initiative planning for the Mobile Growth squad

---

### **üìù Initiative Proposal:**

  

**Title:**

Redesign Mobile Onboarding Flow to Reduce Drop-Off

  

**Problem:**

Our current mobile onboarding experience sees a 45% drop-off rate by step 2. This significantly impacts activation metrics and downstream retention. User feedback indicates confusion around the account creation steps and inconsistent UI on different device resolutions.

  

**Proposed Solution:**

Redesign the onboarding flow to:

- Introduce progressive disclosure
    
- Simplify password creation
    
- Add context-aware tooltips and animations
    
- Leverage faster biometric-based login for returning users
    

  

We will A/B test the redesign with new users.

This project will also address long-standing tech debt in the legacy onboarding frontend.

  

**Supporting Evidence:**

- Funnel analytics from Mixpanel (drop-off at Step 2 is 45%)
    
- 12+ user interviews from UX Research (July 2025)
    
- Session recording analysis
    
- 22 support tickets related to onboarding confusion
    
- Raised consistently in past quarterly customer advisory boards
    

  

**Dependencies:**

- This project must be completed before launching new feature experiments in onboarding
    
- Blocks at least two roadmap items for the growth team
    

  

**Proposed Start:**

Late August 2025

  

**Relative Priority:**

I propose this take precedence over:

- ‚ÄúGamified Onboarding Tutorial‚Äù (a new feature)
    
- ‚ÄúPush Notification Settings Revamp‚Äù (a quality-of-life enhancement)
    
    ‚Ä¶because this initiative directly improves activation, retention, and unblocks multiple teams.

### **üß† How the LLM Uses This Submission:**

  

The structured proposal gives the LLM enough context to:

- **Score the initiative** using PRIORIS+ factors
    
- **Apply modifiers** like blocker_for_initiative and frequently_raised_by_customers
    
- **Compare relative value** to other proposed projects
    
- Output a **ranked JSON object or table** for team-wide prioritization

### **üîÑ Comparison to Other Ongoing Initiatives**

|**Initiative**|**Adjusted PRIORIS+ Score**|**Notes**|
|---|---|---|
|Mobile Onboarding Redesign|10.17|Strategic, unblocker, high impact, high user feedback|
|Gamified Tutorial for Onboarding|6.8|Delighters, but not solving a core pain point|
|Push Notification Settings Revamp|7.2|Important UX task, but no revenue/retention linkage|

This prioritization guides PMs and EMs during planning sessions and supports data-informed roadmap decisions.
