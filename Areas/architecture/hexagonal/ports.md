Port
: a technology-agnostic entry point

A Port determines the interface which will allow foreign actors to communicate with the Application, regardless of who or what will implement said interface.

Ports also allow the Application to communicate with external systems or services, such as databases, message brokers, other applications, etc.

**a Port should always have two items hooked to it, one always being a test**
