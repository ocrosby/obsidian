## Step 1. Start from your goal

Get crystal-clear on:

- Why am I making this project?
- Who is this project for?
- What is going to make it valuable?

This avoids your project from becoming directionless.

**Build something digestible**

**Emphasize clean understandable code**

## Step 2. Write user stories

Examples

- The user should be able to upload a file
- The user should be able to create an account
- The user should be able to view a dashboard

Note: These user stories should remain non-technical

You usually want to have 10-20 user stories before getting started.

The main point is to 

1. write down exactly what a user should be able to do
2. how the app is going to work for them

## Step 3. Define your data models

Sketch out each model and the properties that they might need.

Think through all of the data the app is supposed to manipulate.

For example:

### User's Model

- users may have many posts

### Post's Model

- posts may have many comments

### Comment's Model

- comments belong to users & different posts

## Step 4. Nail a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

For the MVP remove anything previously planned that isn't required for the app to function.

- what actually matters
- what gets you to a working prototype fast
- what doesn't overwhelm you

## Step 5. Draw a simple wireframe or prototype of the app

This can be done on paper, an iPad, or on a whiteboard.

It catches a ton of user experience issues.

## Step 6. Understand what the future of my project is going to look like

Are the decisions I'm going to make today going to impact me in 6 months.

- is it a hobby project
- will it need to eventually scale to thousands of users


## Step 7. Drill into specific components

## Step 8. Pick my stack

Make the stack fit the project

## Step 9. Overall development process

### Create a project skeleton

- basic folder structure
- development environments
- version control

### Setting up the database and creating data models

### Build the backend routes

- API endpoints

### Frontend interface

- connect to the back end

### Project Iteration

gradually add features
deploy early and offten

### Automated Deployments and Testing
