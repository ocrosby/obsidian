## Work with the LLM to write a comprehensive plan

Put your plan in a markdown document inside your repo and keep referring back to it.

After you've created a first draft of the plan go through it and delete or remove things you don't like.

Mark certain features as "won't do" or "too complicated"

Keep a section of ideas for later to tell the LLM that we've considered this but it's out of scope for now. 

Once you have this plan work with the LLM to implement it section by section.
