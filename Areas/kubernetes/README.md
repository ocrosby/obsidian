 provides numerous abstractions and APIs that make it easier to build decoupled microservices architectures.
- Pods, or groups of containers, can group together container images developed by different teams into a single deployable unit.
- Kubernetes services provide load balancing, naming, and discovery to isolate one microservice from another.
- Namespaces provide isolation and access control, so that each microservice can control the degree to which other services interact with it.
- Ingress objects provide an easy-to-use frontend that can combine multiple microservices into a single externalized API surface area.

A Kubernetes cluster consists of two types of resources:

- The `Control Plane` coordinates the cluster
- `Nodes` are the workers that run applications

**The Control Plane is responsible for managing the cluster.** The Control Plane coordinates all activities in your cluster, such as scheduling applications, maintaining applications' desired state, scaling applications, and rolling out new updates.

Control Planes manage the cluster and the nodes that are used to host the running applications.

**A node is a VM or a physical computer that serves as a worker machine in a Kubernetes cluster.** Each node has a `Kublet`, which is an agent for managing the node and communicating with the Kubernetes control plane.
