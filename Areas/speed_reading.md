Whenever you pick something to read, state the purpose or intention for reading it.

The clearer the purpose, the easier it will be for the mind to grasp the information and the faster you can sift through it.

"I'm reviewing yesterday's notes to find answers for tomorrows assignment."

The key is to determine why you are reading the text or what you want to know once finished.

"What can I get out of this material?"

"How will reading it help me?"

Examples:

* I am reading this book to learn money-saving strategies to grow y business.
* I am studying chapters 4, 5, and 6 of the history textbook to ace next week's mid-terms.
* My goal for reading this manual is to improve my computer programming skills for the new project at work.
* I am reading this.  snovel to prepare for tomorrow's literature discussion.
* I am reviewing this book to learn all the facts I need to write an engaging research paper deserving of an A.
* The purpose of reading for the next few hours is to unwind, relax, and get lost in the authors tale.
* I am researching the internet to find a better treatment for my illness.
