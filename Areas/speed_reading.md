Whenever you pick something to read, state the purpose or intention for reading it.

The clearer the purpose, the easier it will be for the mind to grasp the information and the faster you can sift through it.

Example:

"I'm reviewing yesterday's notes to find answers for tomorrows assignment."

The key is to determine why you are reading the text or what you want to know once finished.

"What can I get out of this material?"

"How will reading it help me?"

Examples:

* I am reading this book to learn money-saving strategies to grow y business.
* I am studying chapters 4, 5, and 6 of the history textbook to ace next week's mid-terms.
* My goal for reading this manual is to improve my computer programming skills for the new project at work.
* I am reading this.  snovel to prepare for tomorrow's literature discussion.
* I am reviewing this book to learn all the facts I need to write an engaging research paper deserving of an A.
* The purpose of reading for the next few hours is to unwind, relax, and get lost in the authors tale.
* I am researching the internet to find a better treatment for my illness.

## Add Power with Preview

Preview the material before reading it.

Preview is one of the most valuable steps readers can take to improve reading speed. Previewing helps the mind see all the pieces and understand how they come together. As a result, you can quickly make sense of the material. It helps the mind make more accurate predictions when reading.

With previewing you will experience a greater level of comprehension and may even increase speed.

- Scroll through the text
- Scan the table of contents, major headings, any words in bold or italics, visual aids, and any information that seems relevant.

### Preview Guidelines

Different materials require different approaches to preview.

#### Articles and Reports

Read the first and last paragraphs, examine words in bold or italics, read any quoted texts, and glance at any illustrations.

#### Books and Manuals

Read the front and back covers. Review the table of contents to get a feel for the organization, and notice if the book is divided into sections or parts. Read the chapter headings to get a sense of the topics that will be covered.

Next, read samples of the text. IF there is a preface, begin there. Read also the entire introduction and conclusion. Finally, skim through the book and notice items in bold, italics, quotes, and any diagrams or tables. While skimming, read the first and last paragraphs of each chapter.

#### Textbooks

The approach to textbooks is similar to books and manuals. Focus only on the portion that is assigned.

#### Stories & Novels

If you are reading for an assignment preview, if you are reading for enjoyment don't.
