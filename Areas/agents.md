# NWSL Representation Planning for a Rising Senior NCAA Player

## Context & Corrections

This document outlines **accurate, current guidance** for navigating professional representation for a **rising senior NCAA women’s soccer player** (e.g., Auburn University) with aspirations to sign a **professional contract in the NWSL**.

### ❌ No NWSL Draft

* The **NWSL Draft has been eliminated** under the 2024 CBA.
* Players now **sign directly with clubs as free agents** once eligible.

### ⚖️ Representation Rules (NCAA Compliance)

* NCAA players **may not formally retain (sign) an agent** while maintaining eligibility.
* Players **may receive advice** from agents provided that:

  * No representation agreement is signed
  * The agent does **not** negotiate on the player’s behalf
  * The agent is **not compensated** or promised compensation

➡️ Practically, this allows for **advisory-only conversations** during the senior year.

* Honest readiness and market feedback
* Guidance on timing, combines, showcases, and training environments

**Not Allowed**

This phase is often referred to as **“advisory only.”**
