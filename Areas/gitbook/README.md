## What is it?

It's designed to help teams manage and share knowledge, whether it's for internal documentation, API references, or user guides. GitBook supports collaborative editing, version control (often integrated with Git), and customizable styling. It allows you to write in Markdown or AsciiDoc and offers features like search, integrations with other tools, and access control.
