## What is it?

GitBook is a modern documentation platform where you can create, organize, and host your documentation. It's designed to help teams manage and share knowledge, whether it's for internal documentation, API references, or user guides. GitBook supports collaborative editing, version control (often integrated with Git), and customizable styling. It allows you to write in Markdown or AsciiDoc and offers features like search, integrations with other tools, and access control.

## Getting Started

### Sign Up

Go to the GitBook website and create an account.

### Create a New Space

Once you're logged in, create a new space for your documentation. A space is like a project or a repository where you'll organize your content.

### Choose a Template or Start from Scratch

You can either select a pre-designed template or start with a blank space. Templates can provide a basic structure and styling to get you going quickly.

### Write Your Content

Use the GitBook editor to create and edit your documentation. GitBook supports Markdown and AsciiDoc.

### Organize Your Content

Structure your documentation by creating pages and subpages. You can organize these in a hierarchical manner to make it easy for users to navigate.

### Customize Your Space

Customize the appearance of your GitBook space by changing the theme, adding custom CSS, and configuring the settings to match your brand.

### Collaborate (Optional):
