## What is it?

GitBook is a modern documentation platform where you can create, organize, and host your documentation. It's designed to help teams manage and share knowledge, whether it's for internal documentation, API references, or user guides. GitBook supports collaborative editing, version control (often integrated with Git), and customizable styling. It allows you to write in Markdown or AsciiDoc and offers features like search, integrations with other tools, and access control.

## Getting Started

### Sign Up

Go to the GitBook website and create an account.

### Create a New Space

Once you're logged in, create a new space for your documentation. A space is like a project or a repository where you'll organize your content.
