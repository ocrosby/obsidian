`Insert Mode` is where you can write/edit your documents. From Normal/Command mode, you can use one of the following keys to switch to Insert mode:

`i` switches to insert mode and allows you to edit text right before the current cursor position
`I` switches to insert mode and places the cursor at the beginning of the line
`a` switches to insert mode and allows you to edit text right after the current cursor position
`A` switches to insert mode and places the cursor at the end of the line
`o` switches to insert mode adding a line below the current one
`O` switches to insert mode adding a line above the current one

Just remember: if you need to move between words or lines, you need to switch back to `Normal Mode` by pressing the ESC key.

To save the file, type the `ESC` key to switch back to `Normal Mode` then type `:w`. 

The most important: to quit vim, type `:q` while in `Normal Mode`.
