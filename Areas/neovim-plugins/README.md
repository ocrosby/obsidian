aliases: ["Introduction to Neovim Plugins"]

I keep having ideas of things I would like to add to my Neovim PDE but I can't seem to find a good reference out there on how to generally create plugins so this area is where I intend on making notes I'm taking based on the plugins I've seen.

I really like the plugins I've seen from [Tim Pope](https://github.com/tpope) on GitHub so my approach is going to be to analyze what I see in his plugins and try to create a set of notes that illustrate a good procedure for plugin development for Neovim. Wish me luck.


- Learn to develop Neovim plugins using lua
- Customize and extend Neovim's functionality
- Seamlessly integrate with existing Neovim features and plugins
- Create and share your own powerful plugins

## When to use Plugins

- Macros/Subsitution are good first idea
- Custom lua modules
- Test, deploy, share with the community

## What is a plugin?

- A plugin is just a `lua` module(s)
- We can load it like any other `lua` module
- Remote plugins vs lua plugins

Plugins are about packaging, deployment, and sharing
