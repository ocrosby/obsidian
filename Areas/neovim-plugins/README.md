aliases: ["Introduction to Neovim Plugins"]

I keep having ideas of things I would like to add to my Neovim PDE but I can't seem to find a good reference out there on how to generally create plugins so this area is where I intend on making notes I'm taking based on the plugins I've seen.

I really like the plugins I've seen from [Tim Pope](https://github.com/tpope) on GitHub so my approach is going to be to analyze what I see in his plugins and try to create a set of notes that illustrate a good procedure for plugin development for Neovim. Wish me luck.
