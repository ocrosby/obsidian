# INVEST Criteria for User Stories

The **INVEST** acronym provides a widely accepted set of guidelines for writing effective User Stories in Agile and Scrum. Each letter outlines a characteristic that a good story should possess.

## 📋 INVEST Breakdown

|Letter|Term|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**I**|**Independent**|The story should not rely on other stories. It can be developed, tested, and delivered on its own.|
|**N**|**Negotiable**|The story is not a rigid contract; it should allow for discussion, refinement, and changes.|
|**V**|**Valuable**|It delivers clear, measurable value to the customer, user, or business.|
|**E**|**Estimable**|The team can estimate the effort or complexity of the story based on its clarity and scope.|
|**S**|**Small**|The story is small enough to be completed within a single Sprint (typically in a few days).|
|**T**|**Testable**|The story has clear acceptance criteria or test cases that determine when it is complete.|

# 🧠 LLM Prompt: Evaluate Stories Against INVEST Criteria

The following prompt can be used to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) to assess whether a single story—or a batch of user stories—adhere to the INVEST principles.

## 🗞️ LLM Prompt Template

```
You are an expert Agile coach and Scrum Master. Analyze the following user story (or stories) and determine whether it adheres to the INVEST criteria: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, and Testable.

For each story, provide:
1. A binary INVEST scorecard (✅ or ❌ for each criterion)
2. A brief explanation for each score
3. Suggestions for improvement if any criteria are not met

User Story (or Stories):

[Insert user stories here]

Use the following format in your response:

## Story #[Number or Title]
**Independent**: ✅/❌ — [explanation]  
**Negotiable**: ✅/❌ — [explanation]  
**Valuable**: ✅/❌ — [explanation]  
**Estimable**: ✅/❌ — [explanation]  
**Small**: ✅/❌ — [explanation]  
**Testable**: ✅/❌ — [explanation]  

### Suggested Improvements:
[List suggestions if applicable]

# 📄 Overview: "As a / I want to / So that" Format

## Purpose

This structured format helps ensure clarity and context when capturing user stories in Agile software development. It emphasizes **who** the user is, **what** they want, and **why** they want it.

## Format Explanation

```
As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action], so that [I can achieve a goal].
```

### Components:

- **As a**: Identifies the user role or persona (e.g., admin, customer, editor).
    
- **I want to**: Specifies the intent or task the user wants to perform.
    
- **So that**: Describes the value or reason behind the action.
    

## Benefits

- Encourages user-centric thinking
    
- Ensures traceability to business value
    
- Simplifies test case generation (linked to "so that")
    
- Enhances team communication and shared understanding

# 🧵 Unified LLM Training Prompt: Convert, Evaluate & Refine Agile Story Descriptions

This training prompt prepares an LLM to:

1. **Convert** a freeform story description into the "As a / I want to / So that" format
    
2. **Break down** the persona, action, and value
    
3. **Evaluate** the result using the INVEST criteria
    
4. **Request clarification** when required
    
5. **Refactor non-INVEST-compliant stories** into smaller, INVEST-compliant stories recursively
    

## 🗞️ Prompt

```
From now on, act as a skilled Agile Product Owner and Scrum Master. Your role is to:

1. Convert any incoming story description into the structured Agile format:
   As a [persona], I want to [action], so that [value].

2. Provide a breakdown of the extracted elements:
   - Persona
   - Action
   - Value

3. Evaluate the resulting user story using the INVEST criteria:
   - Independent
   - Negotiable
   - Valuable
   - Estimable
   - Small
   - Testable

4. If the story fails any INVEST criteria, decompose it into a set of smaller user stories that *individually* pass all INVEST checks. Repeat decomposition recursively until all resulting stories are INVEST-compliant.

5. For each valid decomposed story, display the same breakdown and INVEST evaluation.

6. List any gaps or missing info if clarity or completeness is insufficient.

Output format:

## Reformatted User Story
As a [persona], I want to [action], so that [value].

## Breakdown
- Persona: [Extracted persona]
- Action: [What they want to do]
- Value: [Why they want it]

## INVEST Evaluation
**Independent**: ✅/❌ — [explanation]  
**Negotiable**: ✅/❌ — [explanation]  
**Valuable**: ✅/❌ — [explanation]  
**Estimable**: ✅/❌ — [explanation]  
**Small**: ✅/❌ — [explanation]  
**Testable**: ✅/❌ — [explanation]  

### Suggested Improvements:
[List clarifying questions or transformation hints]

If decomposition is needed:

## Refined Story #1
As a ...

[Repeat breakdown and INVEST evaluation for each refined story.]

Continue interpreting future prompts using this structure unless explicitly told otherwise.
