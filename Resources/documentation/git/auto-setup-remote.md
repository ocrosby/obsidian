# Auto Setup Remote

When creating new feature branches I am annoyed by always having to setup the upstream origin. I just found a setting that will do that for you automatically and needed to jot it down so I don't forget about it.

`git config --global push.autoSetupRemote true`

This will effectively automatically setup the upstream tracking branch for you.
