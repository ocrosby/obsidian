## What is Plenary

TJ Devries created plenary.nvim to encapsulate all of the lua functions he didn't want to write twice.

He notes that it is useless outside of neovim since it requires Neovim functions.

One of the really interesting modules in Plenary is the [test harnes](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#plenarytest_harness). This enables a really nice testing environment for creating tests for neovim plugins.
