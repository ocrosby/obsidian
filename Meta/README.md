# Obsidian Vault Organization (Simplified PARA Method)

This Obsidian vault follows the [PARA method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) for digital organization, with a simplified structure to reduce complexity and improve maintainability.

## Simplified Structure

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Inbox/                    # Unprocessed notes and quick captures
â”œâ”€â”€ Projects/                 # Active projects with clear goals
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ scout-sleuth/         # College Recruiting Intelligence Platform
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ neovim-config/        # Neovim configuration project
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dotfiles/             # System configuration
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ study-roadmap/        # Learning projects
â”œâ”€â”€ Areas/                    # Ongoing responsibilities (flattened)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ development/          # Programming languages, tools, editors
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ systems/              # OS, keyboard, tmux, etc.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ learning/             # Educational resources
â”œâ”€â”€ Resources/                # Reference materials (consolidated)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cheatsheets/          # Quick reference guides

```

## Key Simplification Principles

### 1. **Shallow Hierarchy**
- Maximum 3 levels deep
- No more than 10-15 items per directory
- Flatten deep nesting where possible

### 2. **Logical Grouping**
- Related content together
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent naming conventions

### 3. **Clear Separation**
- **Projects**: Time-bound efforts with goals
- **Areas**: Ongoing responsibilities and systems
- **Resources**: Reference materials and documentation
- **Archives**: Completed or inactive content

## Folder Mappings

### ðŸ“¥ Inbox
- Quick captures and unprocessed notes
- Review weekly and move to appropriate locations

### ðŸ—‚ Projects
- `scout-sleuth/` - College Recruiting Intelligence Platform
- `neovim-config/` - Neovim configuration and plugins
- `dotfiles/` - System configuration files
- `study-roadmap/` - Learning projects and roadmaps

### ðŸ§­ Areas
- `development/` - Programming languages, tools, editors
  - `editors/` - Vim, Neovim, and editor configurations
  - `languages/` - Programming language resources
- `systems/` - OS, keyboard, tmux, and system tools
- `learning/` - Educational resources and tutorials

### ðŸ“š Resources
- `cheatsheets/` - Quick reference guides
- `tutorials/` - Step-by-step guides
- `documentation/` - Official docs, git, vimium, etc.

### ðŸ—„ Archives
- Completed projects
- Inactive content
- Historical versions

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Weekly Review**: Process Inbox items
2. **Monthly Review**: Archive completed projects
3. **Quarterly Review**: Consolidate and clean up
4. **Keep it Simple**: When in doubt, flatten rather than nest

## Benefits of Simplified Structure

- **Faster Navigation**: Fewer clicks to find content
- **Easier Maintenance**: Less complexity to manage
- **Better Organization**: Logical grouping of related content
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Clearer mental models
- **Improved Search**: Better discoverability of content
