# Obsidian Vault Organization (PARA Method - Reorganized)

This Obsidian vault follows the [PARA method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) for digital organization, with a reorganized structure that properly classifies content according to PARA principles.

## Reorganized Structure

```bash
.

## PARA Method Compliance

### **Projects** (Time-bound, goal-oriented)
- **scout-sleuth/**: College Recruiting Intelligence Platform with clear timeline
- **dotfiles/**: System configuration project with specific goals

### **Areas** (Ongoing responsibilities)
- **development/**: Ongoing development skills and tool usage
  - **editors/**: Vim, Neovim configurations (ongoing systems)
  - **frameworks/**: React, Next.js, HTMX (ongoing learning)
  - **languages/**: Programming languages (ongoing skills)
  - **tools/**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Argo (ongoing tool usage)
  - **architecture/**: Design patterns and architecture (ongoing knowledge)
- **systems/**: Ongoing system management and customization
  - **shell/**: Zsh configuration (ongoing system)
  - **mac/**: macOS specific settings (ongoing system)
  - **keyboard/**: Keyboard customization (ongoing system)
  - **tmux/**: Terminal multiplexer (ongoing system)
  - **window-manager/**: Tiling window management (ongoing system)

### **Resources** (Reference materials)
- **cheatsheets/**: Quick reference guides for tools and commands
- **tutorials/**: Step-by-step guides for setup and usage
- **documentation/**: Official documentation and specifications
- **references/**: External references, tools, and concepts
- **notes/**: Terminal & CLI tools reference

### **Archives** (Completed/inactive)
- Completed projects and inactive content

## Key Reorganization Principles

### 1. **Proper PARA Classification**
- **Projects**: Only time-bound efforts with clear goals
- **Areas**: Ongoing responsibilities and systems
- **Resources**: Reference materials and documentation
- **Archives**: Completed or inactive content

### 2. **Logical Technology Grouping**
- **Development**: All programming-related content
- **Systems**: All system management and customization
- **Resources**: All reference and documentation materials

### 3. **Consistent Organization**
- Related technologies grouped together
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent naming conventions

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Weekly Review**: Process Inbox items
2. **Monthly Review**: Archive completed projects
3. **Quarterly Review**: Consolidate and clean up
4. **PARA Compliance**: Ensure new content goes to correct category

## Benefits of Reorganization

- **Better PARA Compliance**: Clear separation of content types
- **Improved Navigation**: Logical grouping of related technologies
- **Enhanced Discoverability**: Related content grouped together
- **Easier Maintenance**: Consistent organization principles
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Clearer mental models
