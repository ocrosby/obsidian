When trying to get my leader key working for my new Nulea keyboard I had to first setup [Karabiener-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/). This allowed me to select my new keyboard and map my leader key appropriately.  To test out a key mapping from the terminal I did this.


```shell
C_v C_g
```

If this works I should have seen `^G` as the output but I wasn't seeing that initially. Once I setup the mapping appropriately with `Karabiner` utility I was able to correct the problem with my new keyboard.
